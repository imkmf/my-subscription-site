This demo application requires the following:

- Ruby
- Postgres

Ruby
---

Guides to installing Ruby can be found here:

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/

Note that this application was written in Ruby 2.2 but will work with any Ruby version supported by Rails 4.2.

The author uses the rbenv to manage Ruby versions:

Postgres

Guides to installing Postgres on many operating systems can be found here:

https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides

The sample application uses Postgres 8.4 but is not dependent on a specific version of Postgres. By default, Rails will look for a Postgres service running on localhost. For help configuring Postgres and Rails, see:
